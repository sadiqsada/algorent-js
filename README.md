# AlgoRent
Algorent is a platform for conducting real-estate transactions with crypto. We hope to eliminate the overhead of the current system with a faster, secure, verifiable, unforgeable system.

## Installation
* Clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/sadiqsada/algorent-js.git

* Running the client (from project root containing this README.md file)

       cd client
       npm install 
       npm start
       
* Running the server (from project root containing this README.md file)

       cd server
       npm install
       npm install -g nodemon
       npm start
       
### Notes
* Nodemon keeps the server running as changes are made to the files so that the server doesn't have to be restarted. -g flag stands for global. Installing it globally will allow you to use it for other projects.

* If you need to change the python scraper directory, make sure to delete the environment and remake it in the updated directory.
* To install required libraries use : ```pip install -r requirements```
